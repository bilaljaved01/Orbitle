            Both services include domain provisioning (on eligible plans), SSL certificate, hosting
            infrastructure, and ongoing platform maintenance by TrigrowTech. We reserve the right to
            modify, suspend, or discontinue any feature of either service at any time with reasonable notice.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Account Registration & Security</h2>

          <p>

              <strong>Domain Renewal Charges:</strong> If your domain is provisioned by TrigrowTech as part of
              the service, annual domain renewal charges will be applicable and billed separately at the time

              (.com, .in, .co.in, etc.). We will notify you in advance before renewal. Non-payment of domain
              renewal charges may result in domain expiry and disruption to your website.

          <p>
            All fees are stated in Indian Rupees (INR) and are inclusive of applicable taxes unless stated

          <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            The Orbitle platform, including its codebase, design, branding, and documentation, is owned
            by TrigrowTech and protected by intellectual property laws. Your subscription grants you a
            limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the platform for your travel business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Content you upload to the platform (packages, photos, descriptions) remains your intellectual
            property. By uploading content, you grant TrigrowTech a limited license to display and serve
            that content for the purpose of operating your website.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Domain & Hosting</h2>
          <p>
            For plans on either Orbitle for Operators or Orbitle for Agents that include domain provisioning,
            TrigrowTech will register and configure a domain on your behalf. Key terms:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Domains provisioned by us are registered in our name as part of the service delivery</li>
            <li>Domain provisioning requires a minimum 6-month subscription commitment</li>
            <li>You may bring your own domain on any plan; you retain full ownership of self-provided domains</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Domain Renewal Charges:</strong> Domains provisioned by TrigrowTech are subject to annual
              renewal fees charged at cost. These renewal charges are applicable regardless of your subscription
              plan type and are billed separately from your platform subscription. We will notify you at least
              30 days before your domain renewal date. Failure to pay renewal charges may result in domain
              expiry, during which your website will become inaccessible until the domain is renewed.
            </li>
            <li>Upon account termination or cancellation, we will assist with domain transfer where applicable</li>
            <li>Hosting infrastructure is maintained by TrigrowTech and included in the subscription fee</li>
          </ul>

          </p>

          <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>

            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, TrigrowTech shall not be liable for any
            indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to
            lost profits, business interruption, or data loss, arising from your use of or inability to use
            the platform.

            of any rights of a third party.
          </p>

          <h2>14. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you
            breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the platform ceases immediately. You may
            request a data export within 30 days of termination; after that, your data may be deleted.
