            TrigrowTech ("we", "us", "our") operates the Orbitle platform, accessible at orbitle.com and
            related subdomains. This Privacy Policy applies to both of our services — <strong>Orbitle for Operators</strong>{" "}
            and <strong>Orbitle for Agents</strong> — and explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your

              Includes a branded marketplace website, operator admin panel, agent management, lead distribution system,
              subdomains for agents, and a complete back-office suite — all on the operator's own domain.

            <li>
              <strong>Orbitle for Agents</strong> — A standalone travel website and admin panel for independent travel
              agents. Includes a branded package marketplace website on the agent's domain, lead management dashboard,
